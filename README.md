<h1 id="valuesandvariables"> Values and variables</h1>

## Primitive Data types
every language out there has a group of types.
Different categories for data.
<li>Number - its a numeric value
<li>String - text words, could be a number but inside quotation marks
<li>Boolean - true or false values
<li>Null
<li>Undefined
<li>technically there are two others- Symbol and BigInt

## Numbers in JS
JS has one number type
<li>positive numbers
<li>negative numbers
<li>whole number (integers)
<li>Decimal Numbers(floats)

> clear() - clears the console

with numbers we have different mathematical operations that we can use kind of like a calculator.

> Addition<br> 13+15

> Substraction<br> 15-2

> Multiply<br> 12*3

> Divide <br> 12/6

> Modulo <br> 12%4 - returns the remainder

> // <b>Comments</b> after these two forward slashes


#### exponent or exponential operator
which looks like this two star star.
> 4 ** 2 = 16

### NAN Not a Number
NaN is a numeric value that represents something that is not a number.
> 0/0 = NaN

> 122 + NaN = NaN

It doesn't necessarily mean something went wrong.


### Infinity
which we can generate by doing something like
1 divided by zero javascript just has a way of representing a value of infinity.
> 1/0 = infinity

# Variables

Variables are like "labeled jars" for a value in JavaScript.

We can store a value and give it a name, so that we can--

<li>Recall it
<li>Use it
<li>Or change it later on

 the basic syntax that we'll see first is using a keyword called let.
```javascript
let age = 14;
```
Now there actually are two different ways that we can create variables in JavaScript at least two that
are commonly used today.

how to update a variable
```javascript
age = age +1;
```
we should always keep our variable names in camel case like this
```js
let ageOfTushar = 20;
```
## Unary operators
unary operators are operators where there's only one side.
```js
let counter = 1;
counter++;
```

## Const
const is just like let except we can't change the value.

## legacy of var
before let and const , var was only way to declare the variables. Now there's no reason to use it.
